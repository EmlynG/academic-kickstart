Welcome to my website!

Iâ€™ve set this site up to learn about Hugo and RMarkdown, but I hope to start making use of it as a learning aide, for my interests and generally for my writing.

My current professional interests involve facilitating science and its application through good public policy. I also try to keep an ear to the ground in the world of physics, which I hope to rejoin for a PhD eventually. In my spare time I enjoy cooking (currently lots of Adam Liaw recipes), and satisfy my inner musician through cello and choral singing.

I am currently a Graduate working in policy and public administration for the Commonwealth of Australia in Canberra.
