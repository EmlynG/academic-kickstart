<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
<p>I’ve set this site up to learn about Hugo and RMarkdown, but I hope to start making use of it as a learning aide, for my interests and generally for my writing.</p>
<p>My current professional interests involve facilitating science and its application through good public policy. I also try to keep an ear to the ground in the world of physics, which I hope to rejoin for a PhD eventually. In my spare time I enjoy cooking (currently lots of Adam Liaw recipes), and satisfy my inner musician through playing the cello and singing in a choir.</p>
<p>I am currently a Graduate working in policy and public administration for the Commonwealth of Australia in Canberra.</p>
