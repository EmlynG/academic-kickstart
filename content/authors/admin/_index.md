Welcome to my personal website. I've set this up as a project to learn about RMarkdown, but I hope to extend this website to aide my learning through posts in the future.


My current professional interests involve facilitating science and its application through good public policy. I also try to keep an ear to the ground in the world of physics, which I hope to rejoin for a PhD eventually. In my spare time I enjoy cooking (currently lots of Adam Liaw recipes), and satisfy my inner musician through cello and choral singing.


I am currently a Graduate working in science policy at the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, a part of the Australian Government.
